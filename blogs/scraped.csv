This post will detail some of our research on the Phoenix Contact CHARX SEC-3100 and the bugs we discovered, with a 2nd separate post covering the actual exploit. We’ve adapted the fundamental bug pattern into a challenge hosted on our in-browser WarGames platform here, if you want a hands-on attempt at exploiting the rather interesting C++ issue we discovered. Although an EV charger may initially seem like an “exotic” target with non-standard protocols and physical interfaces, once those are figured out, everything eventually boils down to some binary consuming untrusted input (e.g. from the network), and all the classic memory corruption principles apply.  Why the CHARX? The CHARX was an appealing target for two primary reasons. The first was simply how different it is as a product compared to the other chargers. While the rest of the targets seemed more retail / consumer facing, the CHARX is more “industrial,” a DIN-rail mounted unit seemingly more for infrastructure than actual charging. Its status as an outlier immediately piqued our interest. Another more practical reason was that the firmware could be easily downloaded from the manufacturer’s website, and was not encrypted. The provided .raucb bundle is intended for use with rauc, but can also be treated as a squashfs filesystem image for mounting or extracting directly. Recon - Mapping Attack Surface Once we had decided to actively perform research against the CHARX, we began by enumerating and evaluating potential attack surface. The CHARX runs a custom embedded version of Linux for 32-bit ARM. SSH is enabled by default, with the unprivileged user user-app having default password user. In terms of physical ports, the two of interest to us were the two ethernet ports, labeled ETH0 and ETH1. ETH0 is intended to provide a connection to the “outside world,” most likely a larger network and/or the Internet, whereas ETH1 is intended to connect to the ETH0 port of an additional CHARX. In this manner, CHARX units can be daisy-chained such that they all communicate. Firewall rules within /etc/firewall/rules define which ports (and therefore services) are accessible on these two interfaces. With these rules, some time poking around the system via ssh, and brief reverse engineering, we ended up with the following rough “map” of services, a guide indicating possible attack surface:  CHARX remote attack surface Some services can be interfaced with directly through their TCP servers, while several can only be addressed indirectly through MQTT messages. MQTT employs a publish-subscribe model where a client can subscribe to any number of topics, and when any client publishes a message to a topic, the message will be forwarded to all subscribers. Most of the binaries for these services are located at /usr/sbin/Charx*. Most services are Cython based, where python code (with some extra syntax for native functionality) is compiled into native binaries / shared objects instead of being interpreted. Reverse engineering Cython proved tedious, so we chose to focus mostly on the Controller Agent service, a native C++ binary. Controller Agent Overview The controller agent is represented towards the upper left of the attack-surface diagram, and is reachable over the eth1 port / interface. This port is intended to connect to an additional CHARX, but in our attack scenario we’ll be connecting a machine directly. To provide some context, we came across three main functions of the controller agent: manage communication between other daisy-chained CHARX units manage the AC controller (a separate MCU on the board) V2G (vehicle-to-grid) protocol messaging (related to vehicles selling electricity back to the grid) In terms of actual interaction, the agent can be talked to over UDP, TCP, and the HomePlug Green PHY protocol. We’ll give a brief overview of each communication channel, and discuss specifics later as they become relevant. TCP JSON Messaging The TCP server is conceptually the simplest method of communication. The agent listens on port 4444, accepts messages in JSON format, and provides JSON responses. Each message is a JSON object with the following format: {    ""operationName"": ""deviceInfo"", // operation requested    ""deviceUid"": ""root"",           // target device of operation    ""operationId"": 0,              // reference ID to echo in response    ""operationParameters"": {}      // optional operation-specific params} The deviceUid field specifies the target device in a “device tree” of sorts maintained by the agent. For our purposes, this will mostly be root to indicate the controller agent itself, but there is also a device node representing the AC controller MCU, and there would be other nodes for daisy-chained units if they existed and had performed the proper “handshake.” Some of the supported operations are: deviceInfo : obtain info for specified device childDeviceList : list children in device tree dataAccess : generic hardware data e.g. reading temperature of AC controller (unsupported by root agent) configAccess : read/write configuration variables heartbeat v2gMessage : proxies / handles V2G messages / responses If the target device is the agent itself, the message is handled directly. Otherwise it gets forwarded to the proper device (e.g. proxied to a daisy-chained CHARX). UDP Broadcast Discovery UDP is primarily used for autodiscovery of daisy-chained units, after which communication would occur over TCP. This is done with UDP broadcast packets on port 4444. The basic idea is: root agent broadcasts a deviceInfo JSON request message daisy-chained sub-agent responds root agent gets IP from response, uses it to connect to sub-agent over TCP port 4444 There isn’t much complexity here, since it’s simply for initial discovery. HomePlug HomePlug is a family of protocols for powerline communications (PLC). That is, transmitting data over electrical wiring. Specifically, the HomePlug Green PHY protocol is the one relevant here. The protocol is defined in terms of standard ethernet packets. In practice, a dedicated SoC (e.g. some Qualcomm chip) would perform the translation of ethernet packets into raw powerline signals, and vice versa. It would seem these chips are present on certain CHARX models (although not the 3100 model we had for the contest), intended to be exposed to Linux userspace as interface eth2 (compared to the physical ethernet ports for eth0 and eth1). The usage of PLC is interesting and provides some background, but is ultimately irrelevant, since the protocol is just ethernet, and we only need to concern ourselves with sending / receiving raw packets. Ethernet / layer-2 packets have a 10-byte header followed by the data payload.  Notably, the 16-bit EtherType field in the header determines the protocol, which in the case of HomePlug Green PHY would be 0x88e1. The controller agent sends and receives these packets by opening a raw socket: socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, htons(0x88e1)) Reading or writing to the raw socket sends or receives an entire raw packet, including the header. The indicated protocol 0x88e1 means when reading from the socket, the kernel will only deliver packets with the specified EtherType. The raw socket is bound to an interface, to and from which packets are routed directly. Normally this would be the special eth2 interface for PLC, but the interface can be configured via a configAccess message (over TCP) prior to starting the HomePlug “server.” We can conveniently set this to eth1 (for the physical ETH1 port), to which we’ll already be connected. The HomePlug functionality is closely related to V2G, and the HomePlug “server” is started by sending a v2gMessage request over TCP, with a “subscribe” method type. Bug #1: HomePlug Parsing Mismatch The first vulnerability we used ends up causing a simple null dereference, allowing us to crash the service at will. This may seem useless at first, but will prove its usefulness later on. The HomePlug “server” run by the controller agent reads packets from its raw socket, and handles each one. HomePlug packets are called MMEs (management message entries), and have a 5-byte header followed by the message payload: 1-byte Version 2-byte MMTYPE for the message type, i.e. an “opcode” 2-byte fragmentation info (unused by the agent) Note that rather than being a full implementation, the agent implements only a subset of the features / MMTYPEs of the Green PHY protocol (for instance, ignoring fragmentation info). You can find an archived version of the full spec here. For context, message opcodes commonly come in send / respond pairs. From the spec, the naming scheme follows: Request messages always end in .REQ. The response (if any) to a Request message is always a Confirmation message, which ends in .CNF. Indication messages always end in .IND. The response (if any) to an Indication message is always a Response message, which ends in .RSP. The MMTYPE of interest here is CM_AMP_MAP.REQ (0x601c), which is used to send an “amplitude map.” The message payload is of the form: 2-byte AMLEN indicating the size of the following array of 4-bit numbers n-byte AMDATA of length (AMLEN+1)/2 The agent represents MMEs as subclasses of an MMEFrame class, which for this MMTYPE would be MME_CM_Amp_Map_Req. To parse the various message payloads, which all have different structures, MMEFrame objects use the concept of what I’ve denoted “blobs,” which are chunks of the message body copied out into separate vectors, and tagged with a “type” indicating which field they represent. Parsing populates blobs, MME handling queries / uses the blobs. The following is pseudocode of the constructor for MME_CM_Amp_Map_Req, which is passed a pointer to the start of the MME (including the 5-byte header): MME_CM_Amp_Map_Req(MME_CM_Amp_Map_Req* this, unsigned char *raw, unsigned rawsz, unsigned amlen){    if ( rawsz <= 5 )        return;    if ( !amlen ) { // will be zero when parsing packet as input        amlen = raw[5];        amlen |= raw[4] << 8;    }    this->amlen = amlen;    unsigned short ambytes = (amlen + 1) >> 1;    if ( MMEFrame::hdr_size(a1) + 2 + ambytes > rawsz ) // hdr_size is 5        return;    MMEFrame::add_blob(this, raw, 0, 2, Amp_Map_AMLEN); // copies bytes after header [0, 2)    MMEFrame::add_blob(this, raw, 2, ambytes, Amp_Map_AMDATA); // copies bytes after header [2, ambytes)    this->valid = 1;} Remember that the header is 5 bytes, so the message payload should start at offset 5. Given that AMLEN is the first field in that payload, AMLEN should be bytes 5 and 6. However, this constructor erroneously uses bytes 4 and 5. This incorrect value determines the length of the AMDATA blob stored for later. The “correct” AMLEN is also stored as a blob. What we end up with is the “correct” length in the AMLEN blob, but an AMDATA blob with a completely different size. To see what this “weird state” can lead to, let’s see what happens after parsing. Rough pseudocode of the handler for this MMTYPE is shown below. It essentially copies AMLEN entries in a loop from the AMDATA blob into a “session-local” vector: EVSEMMEHandler::VSLACSession* session = ...;std::vector<unsigned char> blob;MMEFrame::get_blob(&blob, mme, Amp_Map_AMLEN);unsigned amlen = blob[0] | (blob[1] << 8); // ""correct"" length// individually copy entries from the AMDATA blob// MMEFrame::get_amdata is essentially AMDATA[i] but for 4-bit entriesfor (unsigned i = 0; i < amlen; i++)    session->amp_map.append(MMEFrame::get_amdata(mme, i)); The number of loop iterations uses the “correct” AMLEN, however the AMDATA blob being iterated over is not actually that size! If it’s smaller, AMDATA[i] may be out of bounds. Now, you may be thinking… Hold up, I was expecting a meager null deref… this looks more like an out-of-bounds read!   This is technically an out-of-bounds read, and initially seemed promising for an information leak. However, while there did seem to exist code for echoing the “session-local” vector back over the wire, we unfortunately could not find any xrefs or code paths able to actually trigger it. Instead, as a consolation prize, we can utilize the fact that a std::vector of size 0 will have a null pointer for its backing store, and attempting to read from this vector during the loop causes a null dereference. However, the SIGSEGV from the null dereference isn’t necessarily the end of the line for the process, which brings us to our next bug… Bug #2: Use-After-Free on Process Teardown The second vulnerability we leveraged was a UAF that occurred during cleanup before process exit, which we discovered mostly by accident. Sometimes in vulnerability research, you spend weeks staring at code to no avail (which we initially did, finding the HomePlug bug). Other times, you simply attach gdb, continue after a few seconds, and magically get a segfault… The reason this was happening was some sort of system monitor was detecting the service had hung (due to being paused in gdb). The monitor then sent SIGTERM to the process, with the intent of shutting it down cleanly, and restarting the service afterwards. However, some bug was being triggered “organically” during the exit handlers. Exit Handlers In the CharxControllerAgent binary, a considerable number of exit handlers are registered by __aeabi_atexit, which seems to be implicitly emitted by the C++ compiler to destruct globals declared as static. Since static variables are constructed once but stay alive indefinitely, the C++ runtime registers exit handlers to ensure their destruction. The most relevant static global is a ControllerAgent object, a massive root object for encapsulating nearly all of the agent’s state. This is initially constructed in main, where the destructor is also registered as an exit handler. On a related note, the agent installs several signal handlers as well. For SIGTERM and SIGABRT, the handler sets a global boolean indicating the main run-loop should stop, cleanly returning from main. For SIGSEGV, the handler manually invokes exit(1). Consequently, delivery of any of these signals ends up triggering exit handlers. In other words, our previously useless null dereference can be used to invoke the SIGSEGV signal handler, which calls exit and will end up triggering the exit-handling bug! Let’s take a look at what the actual issue turned out to be… Destructors Considered Harmful Before going into the CHARX-specific details, we’ll demonstrate the same bug pattern using a simple toy example, which will be easier to reason about. See if you can spot the bug in the following code… #include <vector>#include <stdio.h>class Outer;// inner class with back-reference to outer classclass Inner {    public:        Outer* outer;        int idx;        Inner(Outer* o) : outer(o), idx(-1) {}        ~Inner();        void init(long val);};// outer class holds inner class and some shared state// (in this case a vector the inner class can add/remove from)class Outer {    public:        Inner inner;        std::vector<long> values;        Outer() : inner(this) {}        int add(long val) {            values.push_back(val);            return values.size()-1;        }        void remove(int i) {            printf(""log values: 0x%lx 0x%lx "", values[0], values[1]);            values[i] = 0;        }};// reserve a slot in the shared vectorvoid Inner::init(long val) {    idx = outer->add(val);}// on destruction, invalidate the slotInner::~Inner() {    if (idx != -1)        outer->remove(idx);}int main() {    static Outer o;    o.values.push_back(0x41414141);    o.inner.init(0x42424242);    return 0;} Consider what occurs when returning from main. This will end up invoking the destructor for Outer, which would have been registered as an exit handler after construction. But, what happens during this destructor? It’s not explicitly defined, so it will be whatever default destructor the C++ compiler creates. According to the C++ Reference: … the compiler calls the destructors for all non-static non-variant data members of the class, in reverse order of declaration … In other words, for Outer, the vector is destructed before the inner class. This leads to the following chain of events when destructing Outer:  This is a very subtle bug, mostly caused by the implicit nature of C++, combined with the pattern of an inner class calling back into the outer class during destruction. An interesting consequence of this implicitness is that simply switching the two lines declaring the members inner and values “patches” the bug, since the destructors would then be called in the opposite order. The ControllerAgent destructor The actual bug follows this same pattern. Almost all of the controller agent’s global structures / state are rooted in a ControllerAgent class instance. In turn, this object’s destructor performs most of the program’s cleanup. As mentioned, this destructor is registered as an exit handler. One of the ControllerAgent fields is a std::list<ClientSession>, a list of “sessions” each representing a connected client. This is the std::vector analog of our toy example. Another field is a “manager” ClientConnectionManagerTcp, which internally holds a list of ClientConnectionTcp objects representing TCP clients. This is the inner analog of our toy example. These two lists are conceptually one-to-one, where each lower-level ClientConnectionTcp has a corresponding higher-level ClientSession. An integral “connection ID” associates each object with the other. When the lower-level TCP connection is closed, the “manager” (ClientConnectionManagerTcp) cleans up both objects. It owns the lower-level object and can perform the cleanup itself, but to clean up the higher-level object, it calls back into a ControllerAgent function to notify it that the matching ClientSession should be invalidated. This involves iterating through the std::list<ClientSession> looking for the matching ID. However, this breaks during destruction, since the std::list<ClientSession> gets destructed before ClientConnectionManagerTcp: ~ControllerAgent kicks off cleanup ~std::list<ClientSession> frees all linked list nodes  this is most likely the default standard-library-defined destructor ~ClientConnectionManagerTcp starts cleaning up lower-level TCP connections  calls back into ControllerAgent to invalidate a connection ID ControllerAgent attempts to search its std::list<ClientSession> for the matching ID in this half-destructed state, this std::list is already gone… UAF! Next Up: Exploitation At this point, we have a UAF primitive, with the caveat that it can be triggered just once on process exit (which we can initiate at will with the null dereference). We found the very subtle destructor ordering issue quite interesting, as an example of how the implicit nature of C++ can lead to unexpected and easy-to-miss vulnerabilities. It’s similarly common to overlook bugs only occurring on process exit. The exploitation process is covered in a follow-up post. Also, if you want to take a crack at exploiting the same core bug pattern (but with ASLR disabled!), check out this challenge on our in-browser WarGames platform.

This documentation covers the full extent of permissions necessary to administrate Telepresence components in a cluster.There are two general categories for cluster permissions with respect to Telepresence. There are RBAC settings for a User and for an Administrator described above. The User is expected to only have the minimum cluster permissions necessary to create a Telepresence intercept, and otherwise be unable to affect Kubernetes resources.In addition to the above, there is also a consideration of how to manage Users and Groups in Kubernetes which is outside of the scope of the document. This document will use Service Accounts to assign Roles and Bindings. Other methods of RBAC administration and enforcement can be found on the Kubernetes RBAC documentation page.RequirementsKubernetes version 1.16+Cluster admin privileges to apply RBACEditing your kubeconfigThis guide also assumes that you are utilizing a kubeconfig file that is specified by the KUBECONFIG environment variable. This is a yaml file that contains the cluster's API endpoint information as well as the user data being supplied for authentication. The Service Account name used in the example below is called tp-user. This can be replaced by any value (i.e. John or Jane) as long as references to the Service Account are consistent throughout the yaml. After an administrator has applied the RBAC configuration, a user should create a config.yaml in your current directory that looks like the following:​The Service Account token will be obtained by the cluster administrator after they create the user's Service Account. Creating the Service Account will create an associated Secret in the same namespace with the format <service-account-name>-token-<uuid>. This token can be obtained by your cluster administrator by running kubectl get secret -n ambassador <service-account-secret-name> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d.After creating config.yaml in your current directory, export the file's location to KUBECONFIG by running export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/config.yaml. You should then be able to switch to this context by running kubectl config use-context my-context.Administrating TelepresenceTelepresence administration requires permissions for creating Namespaces, ServiceAccounts, ClusterRoles, ClusterRoleBindings, Secrets, Services, MutatingWebhookConfiguration, and for creating the traffic-manager deployment which is typically done by a full cluster administrator. The following permissions are needed for the installation and use of Telepresence:There are two ways to install the traffic-manager: Using telepresence connect and installing the helm chart.By using telepresence connect, Telepresence will use your kubeconfig to create the objects mentioned above in the cluster if they don't already exist. If you want the most introspection into what is being installed, we recommend using the helm chart to install the traffic-manager.Cluster-wide telepresence user accessTo allow users to make intercepts across all namespaces, but with more limited kubectl permissions, the following ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, and ClusterRoleBinding will allow full telepresence intercept functionality.The following RBAC configurations assume that there is already a Traffic Manager deployment set up by a Cluster AdministratorTraffic Manager connect permissionIn addition to the cluster-wide permissions, the client will also need the following namespace scoped permissions in the traffic-manager's namespace in order to establish the needed port-forward to the traffic-manager.Namespace only telepresence user accessRBAC for multi-tenant scenarios where multiple dev teams are sharing a single cluster where users are constrained to a specific namespace(s).The following RBAC configurations assume that there is already a Traffic Manager deployment set up by a Cluster AdministratorFor each accessible namespaceThe user will also need the Traffic Manager connect permission described above.ON THIS PAGERequirementsEditing your kubeconfigAdministrating TelepresenceCluster-wide telepresence user accessNamespace only telepresence user accessWas this page helpful?YESShare your feedbackQuestions?Join our SlackContact UsWe’re here to help if you have questions.Edit this page on GitHub"

News that will break the hearts of many for sure. The hearts of most frontend developers out there who have created small projects for themselves. For I have discovered something that most people have not ever talked about...​The death of fun placeholder image generators has come faster than we thought 😔​For those who haven't had the pleasure - it helps a ton to have placeholder images for use during development or as part of small learning projects.​These placeholder images are what they sound like. They are placeholders to be used until you have the actual images to be used on your website or app.​Now technically you can of course just go on google to find (or use AI now to generate) images for use in these projects.​But something I've learned about the dev and design community out there is they're crafty and smart. They don't want to just download an image and use it - They want to make things fun and have different images appear while also respecting the dimensions we need.​Thus placeholder image generators became a huge and fun way to use images in a personal project or even during development.​Take the popular Lorem Picsum generator as an example. They provide you with a specific url where all you do is add the width and optionally the height you need of the image.​Like this:https://picsum.photos/200/300​And then you would use that url as the src to your image tag in the HTML:​​<img src=""https://picsum.photos/200/300"" alt=""Placeholder image"">​​The cool thing about this is because the url can serve any random image that fits in the dimensions. It would so happen that every time you refreshed the page... the image would change!​ ​ (This image may or may not change every time you re-open this email 🤷‍♂️) ​Unfortunately as I have found out, my favorite image placeholder generators are dying on me.​Placecorgi.com was the website to my favorite image generator ever.​As the name implies, it would give you images of corgis in any dimension you needed. It was adorable and useful.​ This was one of my favorites ​The GitHub repo is still available (thank goodness) but the website that used to be deployed from that repo is long gone.​After learning about the death of the website, I wanted to know what other awesome placeholder image generators websites have gone down?​Then I realized...​The list was bigger than I would have liked it to be. placecorgi: Placeholder images of Corgis. Heroku site went down around late 2022 to 2023 fillmurray: Placeholder images of Bill Murray. Went down beginning of 2023. placecage / cage.heroluapp: Placeholder images of Nicolas Cage. Found 2 of them that don't work anymore. Former went down early 2023. Later went down 2022ish (and is more than 12 years old!) placeholder: General placeholder images. Websites were bought by a Warehouse rental firm more than a year ago. lorempixel: General placeholder images. Went down sometime in 2022. imgplaceholder: General placeholder images. Could not find out when it went down. placebeyonce: Placeholder images of Beyonce. Old one but it went down around late 2018. placezombie: Placeholder images of Zombies. Went down around late 2019 - early 2020. placemorty.us: Placeholder images of Morties from the show Rick and Morty. Went down around 2021. Some of these sound so fun! Which makes me sad that there aren't more fun placeholder websites out there.​Granted there are a few good ones I found like: ​lorem.space: Lets you choose by categories like video games, movie posters, album covers and more. ​placingbad.com: Breaking bad placeholder images. ​placekeanu.com: Keanu Reeves placeholder images (They are breathtaking) ​placebeard.it: Placeholder images of the best beards on the internet ​baconmockup.com: Bacon related placeholder images ​placebear.com: Placeholder images of bears. ​place.dog.com: Placeholder images of dogs. Realistically I would have expected a list that's 4 times the size of the one I provided, but honestly I couldn't find many more recent ones.​I sort of wish there were more crazy and funny themed image generators out there. ​At least for the sake of adding to the health, variety and uniqueness of the web.​Ahh well, it's a shame.​For now, just explore some of those links and have fun in your projects. Let me know if you know of any I missed, I'd love to learn more about other generators out there!  113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205 Sick of these emails? ​Unsubscribe by taking the blue pill here​ ​ Exceptional FrontendThe most entertaining frontend newsletter on the webBi-weekly emails that use humor to teach how to become an outlier, level up your career and become an exceptional developer.SubscribeShare this page"

The functions debug(), info(), warning(), error() and critical() will call basicConfig() automatically if no handlers are defined for the root logger. This function does nothing if the root logger already has handlers configured for it. It seems like ipython notebook call basicConfig (or set handler) somewhere.

Grazie) – Frankie Drake Commented Oct 30, 2023 at 9:44  Add a comment  |        41       My understanding is that the IPython session starts up logging so basicConfig doesn't work. Here is the setup that works for me (I wish this was not so gross looking since I want to use it for almost all my notebooks): import logging logger = logging.getLogger() fhandler = logging.FileHandler(filename='mylog.log', mode='a') formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s') fhandler.setFormatter(formatter) logger.addHandler(fhandler) logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG) Now when I run: logging.error('hello!') logging.debug('This is a debug message') logging.info('this is an info message') logging.warning('tbllalfhldfhd, warning.') I get a ""mylog.log"" file in the same directory as my notebook that contains: 2015-01-28 09:49:25,026 - root - ERROR - hello! 2015-01-28 09:49:25,028 - root - DEBUG - This is a debug message 2015-01-28 09:49:25,029 - root - INFO - this is an info message 2015-01-28 09:49:25,032 - root - WARNING - tbllalfhldfhd, warning. Note that if you rerun this without restarting the IPython session it will write duplicate entries to the file since there would now be two file handlers defined   Share Improve this answer       Follow         edited Jan 28, 2015 at 15:10       answered Jan 28, 2015 at 14:56  skulz00skulz00 77988 silver badges1818 bronze badges  2  4  To make this less ""gross looking"", put the code in a module on your python path, and import it. Prettier and easy to upgrade in the future. – alexis Commented Jun 11, 2016 at 12:26  1  Or use logging.config.fileConfig('logging.conf') and put all setup in there. – K.-Michael Aye Commented Dec 28, 2016 at 6:56  Add a comment  |         31       Bear in mind that stderr is the default stream for the logging module, so in IPython and Jupyter notebooks you might not see anything unless you configure the stream to stdout: import logging import sys logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s | %(levelname)s : %(message)s',      level=logging.INFO, stream=sys.stdout) logging.info('Hello world!')

One has to run basicConfig() tp make it work. – Brandt Commented Nov 8, 2019 at 15:56  Add a comment  |        20       As of logging version 3.8 a force parameter has been added that removes any existing handlers, which allows basicConfig to work. This worked on IPython version 7.29.0 and Jupyter Lab version 3.2.1. import logging logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG,      force = True) logging.debug(""test"") After redirecting logs the REPL console, now each keystroke may emit it's own logging message. For example, REPL ptpython begins emitting these log messages after each keystroke. >>> h DEBUG:parso.python.diff:line_lengths old: 1; new: 1 DEBUG:parso.python.diff:diff parser start DEBUG:parso.python.diff:-> code[replace] old[1:1] new[1:1] DEBUG:parso.python.diff:line_lengths old: 1; new: 1 DEBUG:parso.python.diff:parse_part from 1 to 1 (to 0 in part parser) DEBUG:parso.python.diff:-> code[replace] old[1:1] new[1:1]                               [F2] Menu - CPython 3.8.10 DEBUG:parso.python.diff:diff parser end DEBUG:parso.python.diff:parse_part from 1 to 1 (to 0 in part parser) DEBUG:parso.python.diff:diff parser end DEBUG:asyncio:Using proactor: IocpProactor >>> h The REPL becomes so noisy it's unusable. These global logger instances can be quieted by setting the log levels to something less verbose like logging.WARNING. >>> logging.getLogger(""parso.python.diff"").setLevel(logging.WARNING) >>> logging.getLogger(""asyncio"").setLevel(logging.WARNING) This is probably applicable to other REPLs. Just substitute the appropriate noisy logger name in the call to getLogger.

Run %config to see the supported classed, Application is not one of them. ipython 7.9.0 here. – stason Commented Feb 11, 2020 at 5:23   Add a comment  |        6       I wanted a simple and straightforward answer to this, with nicely styled output so here's my recommendation import sys import logging logging.basicConfig(  format='%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(name)s - %(message)s',  level=logging.INFO,  datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S',  stream=sys.stdout, ) log = logging.getLogger('notebook') Then you can use log.info() or any of the other logging levels anywhere in your notebook with output that looks like this 2020-10-28 17:07:08 [INFO] notebook - Hello world 2020-10-28 17:12:22 [INFO] notebook - More info here 2020-10-28 17:12:22 [INFO] notebook - And some more   Share Improve this answer       Follow            answered Oct 28, 2020 at 22:36  yanniskatsarosyanniskatsaros 40866 silver badges66 bronze badges  1   stream=sys.stdout worked for me in Jupyter Lab. – irene Commented Feb 1, 2023 at 6:49  Add a comment  |        5       I setup a logger for both file and I wanted it to show up on the notebook.

Seattle-based Dangerous Things and VivoKey Technologies have a novel way to keep your coins on you at all times: by putting them in you.Wallets are a hallmark of the cryptocurrency space and have been a vital and often frustrating part of the ecosystem from the very beginning. They come in all shapes and sizes, from desktop computer applications and browser plugins to devices the size of credit cards and USB thumb drives. The pill-sized Apex wallet just happens to secure data under your skin.“These wallets are hardware wallets that are meant to be used for sending cryptocurrency,” VivoKey Technologies and Dangerous Things founder and CEO Amal Graafstra told Decrypt in an interview. “Your phone app is your interface, but it doesn't have any private keys. The private key and the actual signing of the Bitcoin transaction, or the crypto transaction, is done in the chip.”The solution is a form of biohacking, a realm where you'll find experiments to extend life or using brain-computer interface (BCI) technology to operate computers. Many biohackers—from researchers to tech enthusiasts—are using subdermal computer chip implants. Graafstra says the Apex chip can be used to store Bitcoin, open a door, or pay for a cup of coffee.ADAD“We have a couple of different Bitcoin and crypto wallets right now that are supported,” Graafstra said. “We have a Satochip wallet, the Seedkeeper application, and the Status IM key card wallet. Those work with different blockchains.”Launched in 2013 and 2017, respectively, Dangerous Things and VivoKey specialize in near-field communication (NFC) and radio frequency identification (RFID) technology customized to be installed inside a human’s body.According to VivoKey, the Satochip is a BIP32/39 wallet applet that allows users to safely store cryptocurrency and securely transact on the blockchain with multiple currency types supported.“The Apex currently comes in a ‘Flex’ form factor, which is a much wider device, but very thin,” Graafstra explained. “And so the procedure is similar; it's a needle, you put the needle under the skin, you remove the needle, and then with sterile gloves, you pick up the Apex Flex, and you slide that into the incision.”ADADCurrently, an Apex Flex implantable device retails for $349.An author, speaker, and biohacker, Graafstra said he got his first RFID implant in 2005, inspired by RFID chips used for pets. Graafstra said he contacted a manufacturer for a custom transponder. After consulting with a doctor, they implanted the chip, installed an access system, and successfully used it to open a door.“The initial impetus for getting an implant in the first place was pure laziness,” Graafstra said. “I wanted to be able to get in and out of this particular door without a key or having to carry or manage anything.”A hallmark of the transhumanist movement that seeks to enhance humanity using technology, subdermal implants have been the stuff of science fiction for decades. Advances in technology, including miniaturization, have now made it possible to implant computer chips safely. See something interesting?

Sourcing materials like silicon chips in small quantities is costly as well.“I would say the probably the biggest challenge is low volume manufacturing in a very high volume industry,” Graafstra said. “We do batches of 2,000 to 5,000 transponders in a run, whereas if you're making cards, you're doing a million, at least—and if you're making animal transponders for industry, you're doing at least 10,000 in a small batch run.”ADADCustomers are undeterred by the price, however.“At the end of the day, people expect it to be expensive because it’s a device that goes in your body,” Graafstra added. “Our costs for producing these are not insurmountable because the customer is comfortable saying, ‘Well, all the safety checks are done, it's been manufactured the right way, I'm going to have this for the rest of my life. So I'll put a little money into it.’”As he explained, the implantation itself takes a matter of seconds, with the longest time spent on prep, bandaging, and ensuring that bleeding has stopped.Notable futurists who have taken Graafstra up on having a chip implanted include entrepreneur, podcaster, and documentarian Briar Prestidge, who documented her experience receiving a Dangerous Things chip for an upcoming documentary. A day in the life of producing a documentary pic.twitter.com/mNDB3WkqEu — Briar Prestidge (@briarprestidge) July 10, 2024Graafstra said people's reluctance to get an RFID implant is mainly due to a lack of perceived use cases.“The first thing they're doing is they're saying, ‘I can't see a use case for me, therefore, I need to come up with a reason not to get one.’ That's where the I'm afraid of tracking comes from,” he said, noting that the chip is not a tracker. “It's not really that fear, because if that were the case, nobody [would have] a cell phone—everybody knows you're being tracked, but the utility is so high, it trumps that.”“The reality is you're owning a very secure, effective hardware wallet that you never lose, you can't forget, right under your skin,” he said. “[The chip] is not permanent, and you can replace it or remove it if you want.”ADADEdited by Ryan Ozawa.Generally Intelligent NewsletterA weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.Your EmailGet it!Get it!ADYour gateway into the world of Web3PartnerNewsDeep DivesUniversityCoinsVideosEvent CalendarPodcastsNews ExplorerBitcoin HalvingAboutTeamDisclosuresManifestoTerms of ServiceCode of Conduct1000x Member Terms of ServicePrivacy PolicyContactCareersJobsShopSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTERThe latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.Subscribe© A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc."

Comments  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.      (Image credit: Valve)  First noted by SteamDB creator Pavel Djundik and reported by The Verge, documents from an antitrust suit against Valve show that the company consisted of 336 employees in 2021. That's a fraction of the size of most big game publishers, even as Steam continues to shape PC gaming as a whole.The documents originate from Wolfire Games' 2021 lawsuit arguing that Steam constitutes an unfair monopoly on PC digital distribution. The documents remain partially redacted, and were likely meant to have all the juicy details fully blacked out⁠—a surprisingly common error in the US legal system that leads to sensitive data being made public.The Verge has a full chart of the year-by year number of employees and departmental payroll changes at Valve. The chart confirms prior reporting that the overall headcount at the company has remained pretty stable for the last 10 years—back in 2016 we reported that the company had around 360 employees, while Wikipedia quoted the company as having 330 in 2013. Here's the topline from 2021: Of those 336 employees, 79 directly worked on Steam, while a whopping 181 remained in the ""Games"" department⁠—pretty much the reverse of what I expected, given Steam's importance to company profits and how rarely Valve releases new games. There were just 41 employees working on hardware development at that time, right on the eve of the Steam Deck's launch, and the remaining 35 employees were in admin.Wolfire Games actually criticized this limited headcount in its lawsuit, arguing that Valve ""devotes a miniscule percentage of its revenue to maintaining and improving the Steam Store."" Last year, a People Make Games report citing interviews with anonymous former Valve employees suggested that Valve's ""flat"" corporate structure hurts its employees.Even with these issues in mind, it's hard not to be impressed with the company's sheer pound-for-pound effectiveness, managing one of the core pillars of PC gaming in Steam⁠—whatever its developer-facing issues, there's a reason most gamers prefer it to other launchers⁠—and revolutionizing handheld PC gaming with the Steam Deck. And whenever the company does get around to releasing a new game (or even just updating an existing one) it's always an event.I've listed a some publishers and developers of note with their respective headcounts to put Valve's into perspective:The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Microsoft Gaming: ~20,100Ubisoft: 19,100Electronic Arts: ~13,700Sony Interactive Entertainment: 12,700Bungie: 1,350Larian: 470Naughty Dog: 400+Bioware: ~270 (post layoffs)New Blood Interactive: ~30Supergiant: 25Team Fortune: 2 Ted LitchfieldSocial Links NavigationAssociate EditorTed has been thinking about PC games and bothering anyone who would listen with his thoughts on them ever since he booted up his sister's copy of Neverwinter Nights on the family computer.
